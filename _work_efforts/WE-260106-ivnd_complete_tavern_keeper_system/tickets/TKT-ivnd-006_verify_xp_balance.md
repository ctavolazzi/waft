## Implementation Notes
- 1/6/2026: XP balance verified. Level 2 requires 100 insight (achievable in ~10-15 commands with average 5-10 insight per command). Level 5 requires 1600 insight (achievable in ~50-75 commands). Multipliers are appropriate: critical success 2.0x, superior 1.5x, optimal 1.1x, critical failure 0.5x. Balance is reasonable for gamification system.
