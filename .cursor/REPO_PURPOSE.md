# Waft Repository Purpose

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-07

## Repository Role

**Waft = Workshop/Sandbox**

This repository is a **development forge** where projects take shape:
- Code drifts in, gets developed, then migrates to permanent homes
- Like a sculptor's studio - the raw clay and shavings stay here
- Finished pieces move to their permanent destinations

---

## Current Status

### Tavern Keeper System
- ✅ **Complete** in waft (Python/Typer CLI implementation)
- ✅ **Migrating** to `treasuretavernhq-web` (TypeScript/SvelteKit port)
- ✅ **Served its purpose** - development complete, ready to move on

### Branch Strategy
- ✅ **Set up and ready** for future projects
- ✅ **Automation scripts** ready for any project
- ✅ **Documentation** serves as template/reference

---

## Future Use

### This Repository Will:
- Continue as a **sandbox** for new projects
- Host experimental development
- Allow code to drift in and out
- Support projects that may migrate elsewhere

### This Repository Won't:
- Hold permanent production code (that goes to destination repos)
- Be tied to any specific project long-term
- Require maintenance of migrated code

---

## Example Workflow

1. **New project idea** → Develop in waft
2. **Project matures** → Migrate to permanent repo
3. **Waft remains** → Ready for next project

**Tavern Keeper Example:**
- Developed in waft → ✅ Complete
- Migrating to treasuretavernhq-web → ✅ In progress
- waft ready for next project → ✅ Available

---

## Branch Strategy Value

The branch strategy we set up is **not tied to Tavern Keeper**:
- It's a **general workflow** for any project
- **Automation scripts** work for any codebase
- **Documentation** serves as reference
- **Ready for future projects** developed here

---

**Philosophy**: The magic is in the development, not the permanence. Projects come, get built, and move to their homes. Waft is the workshop where it all happens.
