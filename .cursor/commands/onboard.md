# Onboard

**Standard new repository onboarding sequence.**

**Use when:** Starting work on a new repository, need to get oriented and understand the project.

---

## Purpose

Provides: new repository onboarding, project orientation, initial analysis, comprehensive setup.

---

## What It Does

Executes this sequence:
1. `/proceed` - Verify context and assumptions
2. `/spin-up` - Quick project orientation
3. `/analyze` - Initial project analysis
4. `/phase1` - Comprehensive data gathering
5. `/prepare` - Prepare for next phase (phase2)
6. `/recap` - Session summary

---

## Execution Flow

```
/proceed → /spin-up → /analyze → /phase1 → /prepare phase2 → /recap
```

Each step:
- Verifies context before proceeding
- Gathers information incrementally
- Builds understanding progressively
- Documents findings
- Prepares for next steps

## Usage Examples

### Basic Onboarding
```
/onboard
```

### Natural Language (AI Recognizes)
```
proceed to spin-up and analyze the project. proceed through phase1 and then prepare to move on to phase2. recap upon completion
```

---

## Integration

This command encapsulates the standard phrase:
"proceed to spin-up and analyze the project. proceed through phase1 and then prepare to move on to phase2. recap upon completion"

You can either:
- Use `/onboard` command directly
- Type the natural language phrase - AI will recognize and execute it

## When to Use

**Use `/onboard` when**:
- ✅ Starting work on new repository
- ✅ Need standard onboarding workflow
- ✅ Want complete project orientation
- ✅ Need comprehensive setup sequence

**Don't use `/onboard` when**:
- ❌ Already familiar with project (use individual commands)
- ❌ Need custom sequence (use individual commands)
