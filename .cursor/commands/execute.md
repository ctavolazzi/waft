# Execute

**Gather all relevant context, then execute the following order.**

Pulls in comprehensive project context (git status, recent changes, active work, goals, etc.) before executing whatever command or instruction follows. Ensures full awareness before taking action.

**Use when:** Need to execute a command or instruction with full context awareness, want comprehensive understanding before action.

---

## Purpose

Provides: context gathering, comprehensive awareness, informed execution, context-aware command execution, natural language instruction execution.

---

## What It Does

1. **Context Gathering Phase**:
   - Git status and branch information
   - Recent file changes and modifications
   - Active work efforts and goals
   - Current project state
   - Recent session history
   - Related files and dependencies

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Executes the command or instruction provided
   - Uses gathered context to inform execution
   - Ensures full awareness before action

---

## Execution Flow

```
Context Gathering → Analysis → Execute Order → Verify
```

**Context Gathering:**
- Git status (branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits)
- File changes (created, modified, deleted)
- Active work efforts and goals
- Project structure and dependencies
- Recent session activity
- Related context from memory layer

**Execution:**
- Executes provided command or instruction
- Uses context to make informed decisions
- Adapts execution based on current state

---

## Philosophy

1. **Context First**: Never execute blindly - gather context first
2. **Informed Action**: Use all available information before acting
3. **Adaptive Execution**: Adjust based on current project state
4. **Natural Language**: Accept both commands and natural language
5. **Comprehensive Awareness**: Pull in all relevant context

---

## Usage Examples

### Execute Command
```
/execute /phase1
/execute /order66
/execute /rampup
/execute /analyze
```

### Execute with Natural Language
```
/execute a thorough cleanup on the current feature branch
/execute a new development cycle using /phase1 as your inspiration
/execute implement user authentication following the existing patterns
/execute review all uncommitted changes and suggest improvements
```

### Execute Command with Context
```
/execute /goal create feature-auth "Implement authentication system"
/execute /recap and save to _work_efforts/
/execute /proceed through /phase1 and /analyze
```

### Execute Complex Instructions
```
/execute refactor the authentication module to use the new patterns we discussed
/execute create a comprehensive test suite for the API endpoints
/execute migrate the database schema following the migration guide
```

---

## Integration

This command ensures comprehensive context awareness before execution. It:

- **Gathers Context**: Pulls in all relevant project information
- **Analyzes State**: Understands current situation
- **Executes Order**: Runs command or instruction with full awareness
- **Verifies Results**: Confirms execution completed successfully

**Works With:**
- Any command (e.g., `/execute /phase1`)
- Natural language instructions (e.g., `/execute implement feature X`)
- Combined commands (e.g., `/execute /rampup on feature/new-feature`)
- Complex workflows (e.g., `/execute /proceed through /phase1 and /analyze`)

---

## When to Use

**Use `/execute` when**:
- ✅ Need full context before executing a command
- ✅ Want comprehensive awareness before action
- ✅ Executing complex instructions that need context
- ✅ Need to adapt execution based on current state
- ✅ Want to ensure informed decision-making
- ✅ Executing natural language instructions
- ✅ Need context-aware command execution

**Don't use `/execute` when**:
- ❌ Simple command that doesn't need context (use command directly)
- ❌ Quick operations (use command directly)
- ❌ Already have full context awareness
- ❌ Just need information (use `/status` or `/context`)

## Context Gathering Details

### What Gets Gathered

1. **Git Context**:
   - Current branch
   - Uncommitted changes (files, status)
   - Recent commits
   - Branch relationships

2. **File Context**:
   - Recently modified files
   - Created/deleted files
   - File change statistics
   - Related files and dependencies

3. **Work Context**:
   - Active work efforts
   - Current goals and objectives
   - Recent session activity
   - Progress tracking

4. **Project Context**:
   - Project structure
   - Dependencies and integrations
   - Configuration state
   - Health and status

5. **Memory Context**:
   - Recent decisions and rationale
   - Patterns and conventions
   - Related work and references
   - Historical context

## Related Commands

- `/proceed` - Verify context before continuing (lighter than execute)
- `/rampup` - Progressive orientation sequence
- `/phase1` - Comprehensive data gathering
- `/analyze` - Analysis and insights
- `/consider` - Analyze options before deciding
- `/context` - Get context summary (read-only)

## Execution Examples

### Example 1: Execute Command
```
User: /execute /phase1

AI: [Gathers context: git status, recent changes, active work]
    [Executes /phase1 with full awareness of current state]
```

### Example 2: Execute Natural Language
```
User: /execute a thorough cleanup on the current feature branch

AI: [Gathers context: current branch, uncommitted files, project structure]
    [Analyzes what "thorough cleanup" means in this context]
    [Executes cleanup with awareness of what's safe to change]
```

### Example 3: Execute with Inspiration
```
User: /execute a new development cycle using /phase1 as your inspiration

AI: [Gathers context: project state, recent work, goals]
    [Understands /phase1 workflow]
    [Creates new development cycle inspired by /phase1 structure]
```

**This command ensures you never execute blindly - it gathers comprehensive context first, then executes your order with full awareness of the current situation.**
