**Keep doing what you're doing, but take this opportunity to really reflect on what you're doing.**

Pauses to deeply reflect on current work, approach, and progress - then continues with improved awareness and potentially adjusted direction. Combines reflection with continuation.

**Use when:** You're in the middle of work and want to pause, reflect deeply, understand what you're doing and why, then continue with better awareness.

---

## Purpose

This command provides:
- **Deep Reflection**: Meta-cognitive analysis of current work
- **Approach Evaluation**: Is the current approach working? Why?
- **Pattern Recognition**: What patterns are emerging?
- **Course Adjustment**: Should we adjust direction?
- **Continued Work**: Then continue with improved awareness

---

## Philosophy

1. **Reflect While Working**: Don't stop, but pause to understand
2. **Meta-Cognition**: Think about thinking, work about work
3. **Course Correction**: Adjust if needed, but keep moving
4. **Awareness**: Continue with better understanding
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Each reflection makes work better

```
User: "/continue"

AI: [Analyzes current work, reflects deeply, provides insights]

AI: 🔍 Reflection Complete
    Current: Working on decision engine Phase 3
    Approach: Designing persistence layer
    Insight: Should implement basic persistence first, then add features
    Continue: Implement Phase 3.1 with this awareness
```

---

### 2. Pattern Recognition
**Scenario**: Notice patterns in work, want to understand them

**Example**:
```
User: "/continue"

AI: [Identifies patterns, reflects on them]

AI: 📊 Patterns Identified:
    • Creating comprehensive docs before implementation
    • This is working well - keeps work focused
    • Continue: Keep this pattern, it's effective
```

---

### 3. Course Correction
**Scenario**: Feel like approach might need adjustment

**Example**:
```
User: "/continue"

AI: [Reflects on approach, suggests adjustments]

AI: 🎯 Course Adjustment:
    Current: Building everything at once
    Better: Incremental approach
    Continue: Focus on Phase 3.1 first, then expand
```

---

### 4. Quality Check
**Scenario**: Want to ensure quality while continuing

**Example**:
```
User: "/continue"

AI: [Reflects on quality, provides feedback]

- **`/resume`**: Picks up from last session (continue reflects on current)
- **`/analyze`**: Analyzes Phase 1 data (continue reflects on current work)
- **`/phase1`**: Gets full overview (continue is more focused)

---

❓ Reflection Questions

What am I doing?
  Creating a /resume command that restores context from previous sessions,
  allowing seamless continuation of work. Building session continuity system.

Why am I doing it?
  To improve workflow efficiency and reduce context-switching overhead.
  Enables picking up exactly where work left off.

How am I doing it?
  Following established patterns: command definition → implementation → integration.
  Using existing managers (GitHubManager, GamificationManager) for consistency.
  Comprehensive documentation and error handling.

Is it working?
  ✅ Yes - implementation is complete and working.
  ✅ Pattern is effective - systematic approach yields good results.
  ✅ Quality is high - well-documented, tested, integrated.

Should I adjust?
  ✅ Current approach is working well.
  💡 Consider: Could add session selection UI for better UX.
  💡 Consider: Could integrate with work efforts system.
  → Continue: Keep current approach, add enhancements later.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 Adjusted Continuation

Insights to Apply:
  • Documentation-first approach → Continue thorough documentation
  • Pattern consistency → Keep following existing code patterns
  • Systematic methodology → Maintain structured approach

Course Adjustments:
  • None needed - current approach is effective
  • Future: Consider session selection UI
  • Future: Consider work efforts integration

Continue With:
  • ✅ Keep: Comprehensive documentation
  • ✅ Keep: Following existing patterns
  • ✅ Keep: Systematic implementation approach
  • 💡 Add: More integration points (work efforts, analytics)

Next Steps (with awareness):
  1. Update command recommendations and devlog
     → Why: Document the new command, maintain project history
     → Reflection: Documentation is part of the systematic approach

  2. Test resume command with various scenarios
     → Why: Ensure robustness across different session types
