# Explore Command Enhancement

**Date**: 2026-01-06
**File**: `.cursor/commands/explore.md`

## Enhancement

Updated the explore command to actively encourage using available tools during exploration:
- Empirica (epistemic tracking)
- _pyrite (memory layer)
- MCP servers (work-efforts, docs-maintainer, github, memory, filesystem)
- Waft commands (info, verify, stats, etc.)

## Key Changes

1. **Added "Active Tool Usage" section** with:
   - Empirica workflow (session, findings, unknowns, postflight)
   - _pyrite documentation patterns
   - MCP server usage examples
   - Waft command integration

2. **Enhanced each step** with:
   - Specific tool usage instructions
   - Documentation requirements
   - Finding/unknown logging prompts
   - MCP integration examples

3. **Added Tool Usage Checklist**:
   - Empirica usage
   - _pyrite documentation
   - MCP server usage (work-efforts, docs, github, memory, filesystem)
   - Waft commands
   - Git history
   - Semantic search

4. **Updated Notes section** to emphasize:
   - Actively using tools (not just reading)
   - Documenting as you go
   - Logging findings and unknowns
   - Using MCPs proactively

## Philosophy

The explore command now emphasizes:
- **Active exploration** - Use tools, don't just read
- **Documentation during** - Not after
- **Epistemic tracking** - Log what you learn
- **Tool integration** - Use all available resources
- **Knowledge building** - Create entities/relations in memory

## Result

The explore command now guides AI to:
1. Use Empirica to track learning
2. Document in _pyrite as discoveries happen
3. Use MCPs to gather information
4. Use waft commands to understand project
5. Build knowledge graph of discoveries
6. Log findings and unknowns actively

This makes exploration a **tool-using, knowledge-building activity** rather than just reading code.
